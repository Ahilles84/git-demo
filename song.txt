My my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Waterloo — I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo — Promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo — Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo — Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo — Finally facing my Waterloo.
